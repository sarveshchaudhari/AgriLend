# Loan-Delinquency-Prediction

Agricultural Loan and Crop Suitability Prediction

This project provides a machine learning-based solution to assist farmers and financial institutions by predicting:

Loan Approval Decision: Determines if a loan should be approved based on features like credit score, land size, and financial history.
Loan Amount Prediction: Predicts the potential loan amount based on input data.
Risk Score Prediction: Calculates a risk factor for the loan application.
Crop Suitability Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crops for planting based on environmental conditions like soil type, rainfall, temperature, and humidity.

The model is trained using regression and classification techniques with features including land size, location, climate parameters, and financial details.
